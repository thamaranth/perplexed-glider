## Description

This goal provides an introduction to functional programming concepts using JavaScript and gives you the opportunity to practice these concepts with a series of reinforcement exercises from the [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/) and a handful of automated challenges on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages?tags=Functional+Programming).

## Context

Functional programming patterns are becoming increasingly popular in the web development community. Using these patterns results in code that is more adaptable and flexible, less buggy, and more scalable. 

The article [The Two Pillars of JavaScriptâ€Š: Pt 2: Functional Programming
How to Stop Micromanaging Everything](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4#.p9gfmzfel) goes into many of the reasons why you might want to consider learning how to write JavaScript as a functional programmer would.

## Specifications

- [X] Read the [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/) through Chapter 8: Tupperware
- [X] Complete the exercises in the Mostly Adequate Guide (note: there aren't exercises after each chapter - just the ones on Ch 5: Currying, Ch: 6: Coding by Composing, and Ch: 8 Tupperware).
